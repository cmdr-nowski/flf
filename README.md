E.g.

```
https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/340466-Missing-POI-for-SJK-378-A-B-C-Listening-Posts
```

goes to:

```
https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/340466
```

On arrival, the forum will put the full url:

```
https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/missing-poi-for-sjk-378-a-b-c-listening-posts.340466/
```

Trivially doable manually, and probably quicker than using this, but here it is anyway :)
